## What is NightOS?

NightOS is an operating system aiming to replace ancient systems like Windows, Linux or MacOS. Well, this is the _ideal_ goal but given how much Windows/Linux/MacOS and other systems are deeply installed in today's computers, NightOS is more of a theorical operating system that shows what we could get if we hadn't to maintain legacy compatibility with ancient architectures.
