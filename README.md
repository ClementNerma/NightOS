# NightOS

![NightOS Logo](logo.png)

NightOS is an experimental general-purpose operating system aiming to provide the highest security and safety to the average user, while remaining powerful enough to be fast, efficient and highly customizable for more advanced users.

It is currently [undergoing complete design](docs/).

## Features

* Extreme customization, up to the kernel itself
* Data loss prevention with [crash saves](docs/features/crash-saves.md)
* Secured with the [permissions system](docs/specs/permissions.md) and [sandboxes](docs/features/sandboxes.md)
* Secured to external attacks with [by-default encryption](docs/features/encryption.md)
* Resilient to freezes with the [freeze prevention system](docs/features/freeze-prevention.md)
* Customize the environment and use it anywhere thanks to [synchronization](docs/features/synchronization.md)
* Remote computers management using [domains](docs/features/domains.md)
* Built-in [parental control](docs/features/parental-control.md)
* Native applications for [common tasks](docs/applications/)
* ...and [many others](docs/)

## Documentation

Design and specification documents can be found in the [`docs`](docs/) directory.

The documentation is also live at [`https://clementnerma.github.io/NightOS`](https://clementnerma.github.io/NightOS).

## What is NightOS?

NightOS is an operating system aiming to replace ancient systems like Windows, Linux or MacOS. Well, this is the _ideal_ goal but given how much Windows/Linux/MacOS and other systems are deeply installed in today's computers, NightOS is more of a theorical operating system that shows what we could get if we hadn't to maintain legacy compatibility with ancient architectures.
