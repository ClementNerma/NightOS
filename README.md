![NightOS Logo](logo.png)

NightOS is an **highly experimental** general-purpose operating system aiming to :

* Provide maximum security to the average user
* Be easily extensible and customizable by the average user
* Be easy and intuitive to use

## Documentation

Design and specification documents can be found in the [`docs`](docs/) directory.

The documentation is also live at [`https://clementnerma.github.io/NightOS`](https://clementnerma.github.io/NightOS).

## What is NightOS?

NightOS is an operating system aiming to replace ancient systems like Windows, Linux or MacOS. Well, this is the _ideal_ goal but given how much Windows/Linux/MacOS and other systems are deeply installed in today's computers, NightOS is more of a theorical operating system that shows what we could get if we hadn't to maintain legacy compatibility with ancient architectures.
