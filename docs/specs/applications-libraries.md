# Applications and libraries

This document describes the structure, features and behaviours common to both [applications](../concepts/applications.md) and [libraries](../concepts/libraries.md).

## Name and slug

Each application has a name as well as a slug. The name can any valid UTF-8 string, while the slug must respect several rules:

- Only lowercase letters, underscores and digits
- Must not start by a digit
- Must not be the name of a native shell command
- Must not be the name of a native shell function
- Must not be the name of a shell type

By default, the slug is auto-generated from the name, but it can also be customized.

## Application Identifier

From the slug is generated the _Application's IDentifier_ (AID), which is prefixed by the developer's identifier (DID) specified in the application's manifest (it must match the publisher's identifier on the store), and followed by two double points. The DID is submitted to the same rules as the application's slug.

For instance, an application with a slug of `utils` made by a developer whose DID is `superdev` will get an AID of `utils::superdev`.

The AID is unique across the store as well as in a single NightOS installation. As malicious application may provide the DID and the slug of a legit application (which is called _AID spoofing_), sideloading is [verified by default](../concepts/applications.md#sideloading).

As AID are text-based and can be quite long (up to 512 bytes), programs can instead use the _Application's Numeric IDentifier_ (ANID), which is a 32-bit unique number randomly generated by the system to refer to this particular application. On two different systems, the ANID of a given application will likely be very different, and so cannot be guessed. It is provided by the system during the application's launch through its [context](applications/context.md).

System applications are registered under the reserved `sys` DID.

## The manifest

A _manifest_ is a file describing the application or library. It is mandatory to build and distribute it. Its content differ for applications and libraries, but there are common fields (`REQ`: required, `OPT`: optional):

```yaml
# [REQ] Informations about the application
infos:
  # [REQ] Application's name, as shown when installing it
  name: Cloud Notepad App
  # [REQ] Application's slug, as stored on the disk in the /apps directory
  slug: cloud-notepad-app
  # [REQ] Application's description, as shown when installing it
  description: A notepad application that allows syncing your files in the cloud
  # [REQ] Application's version, following semantic versioning
