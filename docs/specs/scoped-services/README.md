# System-related scoped services

This document lists all system-related [scoped services](../services.md#scoped-services), which are services whose methods and notifications follow a convention established by the system itself.

An application exposing such a service in its [manifest](../applications/manifest.md) will automatically be assignable to specific tasks, such as being set as the default desktop environment or file manager.

These scoped services' name start with a `SYS_` prefix to indicate their convention.
