# Integration services

This document lists all [integration services](../../services.md#types-of-services), which are services whose methods and notifications follow a convention established by the system itself to permit an integration at different levels.

An application exposing such a service in its [manifest](../../applications/manifest.md) will automatically be assignable to specific tasks, such as being set as the default desktop environment or file manager.

These services are not available directly to the end applications ; they can only be used through [system services](../../services/system/README.md).
