# Shell

The _shell_, called *Hydre*, is the part that interprets scripts.

## Commands

Hydre works using _commands_, which can take _arguments_.
When running a command which comes from an applications which [expose it](../concepts/applications.md#commands), the said application is run in a new process which uses its [execution context](../specs/applications/context.md).

## Scripting language

You can find more about the script language in the [related document](../specs/shell-scripting.md).
