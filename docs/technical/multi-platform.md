# Multi-platform

NightOS programs can be ran either on Linux, Windows or MacOS systems using a wrapper called the _NightOS Calls Wrapper_ (NCW).
It can be downloaded from NightOS' official website.

When installed on a system, it allows to use NightOS applications natively, although permissions management will not be as smooth and many options will not be available (e.g. no desktop, no access to native NightOS applications - only native libraries, etc.).
